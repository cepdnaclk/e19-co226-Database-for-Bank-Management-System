## How to Run the Project

1. **Start Required Services:**  
   Ensure that your MySQL database and local server (like Apache) are up and running.

2. **Setup the Database:**  
   - If using the MySQL Command-Line Interface (CLI):
     1. Run the `main_structure.sql` file first: `SQL/main_structure.sql`
     2. Then, run the `data.sql` file: `SQL/data.sql`
   - If using a Web User Interface (like phpMyAdmin):
     1. Import `main_structure.sql`
     2. Then import `data.sql`.

3. **Access the Landing Page:**  
   - If you're using WAMP and have placed the project files in a folder named 'project-cloned' within the 'www' directory (for XAMPP htdocs):
     - Open your browser and type: `localhost/project-cloned`
     - Hit Enter to access the landing page.
