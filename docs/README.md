## Introduction

Banking, an essential service worldwide, has undergone tremendous changes over the years. From the introduction of electronic banking to the rise of fintech innovations, banking has been at the forefront of adapting to consumers' evolving needs. With the proliferation of online transactions, there's an increasing demand for swift, secure, and seamless banking services that are both user-friendly and efficient.

To cater to this need, a sophisticated banking management system is imperative. This system should be capable of consolidating various banking activities such as account management, transactions, and loan provisions, among others. More so, in this data-driven era, it is crucial to have a platform that not only manages these operations but also offers insights into customer behaviors and transaction patterns.

The proposed Treasure Island Banking Service seeks to fulfill these demands. It provides an innovative platform to manage, analyze, and retrieve banking data, while its unique 'treasure hunt' theme promises an engaging user experience. Envisioned as a comprehensive solution, this platform is poised to be an invaluable asset for users, banking professionals, and analysts, ensuring they're always a step ahead in the modern banking world.


## Purpose of the Database

The objective of this system is to archive, orchestrate, and access information regarding banking transactions, account details, and financial analytics. It's tailored to be an indispensable tool for account holders, banking professionals, financial analysts, and even students keen on diving into the intricacies of financial management.

Utilizing a meticulously structured database, users can:

..* Browse and access detailed account profiles and transaction histories, user profiels, loan information.

..* Add new data and remove existing data from database. 
..* Get in touch with customers using notices.
